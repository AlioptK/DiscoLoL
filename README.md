# DiscoLoL
## A mini project made for those who sometimes want to play without being bothered or distracted.
### With this, you can appear disconnected when playing League of Legends.

##### Download the executable here : http://bit.ly/DiscoLoL
### No chances of getting banned whatsoever because this software only modifies the system.yaml file of your client (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/b0lhi5/can_changing_languages_systemyaml_file_lead_to_a/) for more information ).
#### Dependency (if you want to run the raw code):

ruamel_yaml : pip install ruamel.yaml
